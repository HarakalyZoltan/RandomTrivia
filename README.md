# RandomTrivia
A simple trivia app with random questions from a pool of 912.

The user can answer with true or false. There are 3 difficulty settings which lower the players time to answer for each question 
and lower their lives. The final score can be shared with a press of a button.
The app has a simple settings menu where the user can mute the application or turn on/off vibration.

If the player runs out of time or runs of of lives he can choose to watch an ad to get +1 life and try again.
